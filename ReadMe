Data reconstruction using projection onto convex set (POCS) or fast iterative thresholding algorithm (FISTA)

Input: Binary undersampled data 
 
Output: Binary data after reconstruction 

Synopsis:
         This program takes the file name of binary file of a patch of seismic data. 
         Subsequently, it executes the reconstruction program based on user's preference (e.g., FISTA, and POCS) and recosntruct data. 
         This program writes the binary file in the storage after reconstruction. 
         It can also digest several input binary data patches and reconstruct one after another. 


Required files:
===============
1. FFTW 3.3.0
2. g++


To compile and run:
===================

1. cd /.../pocs5D/Debug
2. make clean
3. make all
4. ./pocs5D
